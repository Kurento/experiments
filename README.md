# Kurento experiments

This repo contains any kind of tests, proof of concepts, or experiments that the Kurento team might write as part of Kurento's development, and that are considered worth keeping for future reference.

None of these lines of code are supported by any means, so be warned: *here be dragons*.

Note to Kurento developers wanting to introduce new experiments: GitHub aggressively removes from Markdown files any HTML codes that could be harmful to users, such as scripts and iframes. For example, trying to embed a jsFiddle demo into a README.md won't work.
